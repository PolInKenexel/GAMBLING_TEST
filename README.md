I still have a dream, is a dream deeply rooted in the Nevada dream...

I have a dream that one day this Casino will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that 90% of gamblers quit before they hit it big"...

I have a dream that one day in the Caesars Palace of Las Vegas, the sons of former called gambling addicts and the sons of former non gamblers will be able to sit down together at the table game...

I have a dream that one day even the country of Saudi Arabia, a country sweltering with the prohibitions of betting, will be transformed into an oasis of risking and waging...

I have a dream that my 4 gambling bros and me will one day live in a family where we'll not be judged by the losses of our games but by their incomes...

I have a dream today!
